Similarity and Association: 
Principles of Distributed Semantic Processing in the Human Brain, 

a research project conducted within the Cogmaster M2 research internship.


## What is Micipsa

How are word-meanings comprehended in natural languages, and how does our brain process lexical semantics? If word-meanings and concepts emerge based on perceptual/affective input, how are the abstract concepts processed? How does the usage of language refine word-meanings? We approach the neural processing of lexical semantics by dissociating the generalized, abstract and amodal *similarity* from sensorimotor/affective/syntagmatic semantic *association* information. These two hypothetical semantic principles are proposed to accommodate structural linguistic theories, pathological observations and neuroscience models. By hypothesizing that *similarity* is an hierarchical taxonomical organization of concepts based on Patterson et al's semantic-hub (and Paivio's dual-coding theory), we are able to build computational semantic representation models and that of *association* as an umbrella term, comprising perceptual-, affective- and episodic-dependent semantics as well as phrasal semantic control. fMRI recordings conducted in an ecological auditory narration comprehension setting serve as ground truth data. With an fMRI voxel-level neural activity encoding experiment with linear regression models and semantic representation models finely-tuned for each of the two semantic principles, the local preferences shown for the principles are contrasted by the regression model accuracy scores. Notably we tested the theorized anteroventrotemporal loci of semantic hub, and the results suggest the hub processes semantics of a mixed nature.
